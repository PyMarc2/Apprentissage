# Apprentissage
Bunch of codes that I will use to either practice or do some tests. 
You can look through those files and use the code as you please.

* **Stack Overflow:** contains all the code I have used to either ask questions or answer questions on StackOverflow
* **getSlackFiles:** takes a .txt file containing information and urls to downloadable file history on slack.
It retreives all the files with good name and extension. Could potentially save everything according to discussion/date
* **ProjectEuler:** Contains programming challenges and problems from projectEuler.net.
