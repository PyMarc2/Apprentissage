# Apprentissage
Bunch of codes that I will use to either practice or do some tests. 
You can look through those files and use the code as you please, please at least acknowledge my work and contribution.

* **stack-overflow:** Contains all the code I have used to either ask questions or answer questions on StackOverflow.
* **get-slack-files:** Takes a slack url to download all file history on slack.
It retreives all the files with good name and extension. Could potentially save everything according to discussion/date/category.
* **projet-euler:** Contains programming challenges and problems from projectEuler.net.
* **pic18-timer-interface:** Libraries and interface for pic18f47k42, all built from scratch.
* **live-nasa-wallpaper:** Python program that uses a livefeed 'BLOB' url and makes a live video wallpaper of that livefeed.
